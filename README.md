# n8n ClamAV Sentinel

A full-featured **n8n workflow** that runs a **weekly ClamAV scan via SSH** and posts alerts/reports to **ntfy**.

> Triggered weekly (Sunday 03:00). Runs `clamscan`, parses results, and notifies through ntfy with rich summaries.

## Workflow Summary

- **Cron Weekly (Sun 03:00)** â†’ **SSH ClamAV Scan** â†’ **If Infected (text check)** â†’  
  â€¢ **ntfy Infected (HTTP POST)** (ðŸš¨ priority 5 with FOUND file lines + summary)  
  â€¢ **ntfy Clean (HTTP POST)** (âœ… summary with counts and times)

## Features

- SSH execution of `clamscan -r /path/to/scan -i`  
- Infection alerts show top 10 lines containing `FOUND` plus scan summary  
- Clean report includes `Scanned`, `Infected`, `Time`, `Start Date`, `End Date` lines  
- Posts to `https://ntfy.sh/<your-topic>` with headers (`X-Title`, `X-Priority`)  
- Works with public or self-hosted ntfy servers

## Setup

1. Import workflow:
   - UI: Workflows â†’ Import from File â†’ select `workflows/clamav_weekly_scan_full.json`
   - CLI: `./scripts/import.sh`
2. In SSH node, configure credentials (`your SSH credentials`).
3. Adjust path `/path/to/scan` or schedule as needed.
4. Ensure ClamAV is installed on the remote host.

## Customization

- **Topic:** replace `https://ntfy.sh/<your-topic>` with your ntfy topic  
- **Threshold / parsing:** workflow checks for `Infected files: 0` absence to flag infection  
- **Priority:** change `X-Priority` values for clean/alert messages

## Security Notes

- Use SSH keys over passwords when possible.  
- Limit scope of user running ClamAV for safer scans.
